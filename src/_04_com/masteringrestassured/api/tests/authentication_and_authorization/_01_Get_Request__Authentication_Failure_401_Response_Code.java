/* The majority of the time you will be hitting REST API�s which are secured. By secure 
   we mean that the API�s which require you to provide identification. Identification 
   can be provided in the form of Username and a Password, Authentication tokens, Secret keys
   and Biometrics, amongst others

   A REST request can have a special header called Authorisation Header, this header can 
   contain the credentials (username and password) in some form. Once a request with 
   Authorization Header is received, server can validate the credentials and can let you 
   access the private resources */
